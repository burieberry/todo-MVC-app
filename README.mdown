This version created February 2017.

Here's the [Source repo](https://github.com/udacity/ud989-todo-app).
Uses Backbone.js organization library.

## Added features & functionalities
- When an item is checked, `--DONE` will be added at the end of the todo item.
- Now there's an Edit button (pencil icon) on the todo items.
- When you hover over an item, there's a prioritize button (`!` icon). Click on it and text will turn red.
